Different algorithms for forecasting sales and finding the predictive value of ongoing trends and also predict the future forecasting

An autoregressive integrated moving average, or ARIMA, is a statistical analysis model that uses time series data to either better understand the data set or to predict future trends.<br>
A statistical model is autoregressive if it predicts future values based on past values. For example, an ARIMA model might seek to predict a stock's future prices based on its past performance or forecast a company's earnings based on past periods.

Prophet is a method for predicting time series data that uses an additive model to suit non-linear trends with seasonality that occurs annually, monthly, daily, and on weekends as well as during holidays. Strongly seasonal time series and multiple seasons of historical data are ideal for it. Prophet typically manages outliers well and is robust to missing data and changes in the trend.
