Prophet is a method for predicting time series data that uses an additive model to suit non-linear trends with seasonality that occurs annually, monthly, daily, and on weekends as well as during holidays. Strongly seasonal time series and multiple seasons of historical data are ideal for it. Prophet typically manages outliers well and is robust to missing data and changes in the trend.
